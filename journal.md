# Abstract
We write this last because it is difficult to do. This is where we summarise the main results so lazy people don't have to read the whole thing but can still reference it.

# Introduction
Haywood et al (1999) made some great measurements of BBOA over the Sahara. 
We add to these measurements, with chemical composition data, using an aerosol mass spectrometer (Allen et al 2000).

# Simulations
John has made some simulations of particle formation using his box model.
It reproduces the growth in size distribution observed and suggests coagulation as the dominant method of growth.

# Methodlogy
We used an AMS (Allen et al 1998) to measure particle mass and chemical composition.


# Results
We observed particle growth through coagulation, and report the changing chemical composition with age in the atmosphere.

# Conclusions
We made some ground breaking discovery, aren't we great.
There's more to do, give us more funding.

# Figures
This is where the figures go in a draft manuscript.
